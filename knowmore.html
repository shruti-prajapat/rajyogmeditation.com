          <p>Brahma Kumarism: a strictly millenarian (End of the World), spiritualist cult based on mediumistic teachings from a “spirit entity” adherents believe is the god of all religions. “God”, the Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University teaches, speaks to humanity exclusively through their psychic mediums only.</p>
          <p>Brahma Kumaris Godly Spiritual University is established by the incorporeal God-Father Shiva (the Supreme Soul) as a foundation to recreate the new heavenly world. It is also an internationally recognised non-governmental organisation (NGO) helping people from all religious and cultural background to recognise and experience the inner being (soul) and bring positive and magical transformation in personal lives through the practice of rajyoga meditation.</p>

        <p>The Brahma Kumaris, originally called Om Mandali, started in Hyderabad, Sindh in north-west India (present-day Pakistan)[7] It received this name because members would chant "Om" together, before having discourse on spiritual matters in the traditional satsang style. The original discourses were closely connected to the Bhagavad Gita

          <br><br>
  
          He founder, Lekhraj Khubchand Kirpilani (who became known in the group as "Om Baba") was a wealthy jeweler.[7] He reported what he said were a series of visions and other transcendental experiences that commenced around 1935 and became the basis for the discourses. He said he believed there was a greater power working through him and that many of those who attended these gatherings were themselves having spiritual experiences.[7] The majority of those who came were women and children from the Bhaibund caste[8] - a caste of wealthy merchants and business people whose husbands and fathers were often overseas on business.

          In spite of the incredible social upheavals which were going on in pre-Partition India, these people came together, initially in Hyderabad and a year later they moved to Karachi. With time, a simple and clear body of knowledge about the nature of the soul, God and time became revealed. In 1950 (two years after Partition), the group moved to its present location in Mount Abu, India. Until then, these nearly 400 individuals lived as a self-sufficient community, devoting their time to intense spiritual study, meditation and self-transformation.

        <h4>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was Bramha Baba?</h5>
        <br><br>
       <p align="center">  Brahma Baba, born in a humble home as Lekhraj Kriplani in the 1880s, was the son of a village schoolmaster. Lekhraj was brought up under the discipline of Hindu tradition. After various jobs, he entered the jewelery business, later earning a substantial amount as a diamond merchant. He was the father of five children and a leader within his local community, particularly known for his philanthropy. In 1936, around the time most people his age begin planning for their retirement, he actually entered the most active and engaging phase of his life. After a series of profound spiritual experiences and visions, he felt an extremely strong pull to give up his business and devote his time, energy and money to laying the foundation for what would later become the Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University.

Between 1937 and 1938, she formed a management committee of eight young women and bequeathed all her wealth and property to a trust administered by them.
